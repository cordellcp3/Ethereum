# Solidity_DataHelper
Utility-contract to make it easier to work with data structures like arrays, maps or dictionaries

Just "import" this contract to your project and use the contains()-function like 
one would do in Java or C# for data-structures. This is a view-functions, so very
cheap on the ethereum network.
